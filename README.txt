I have done this problem using C language but i suggest if you know any other language than C do it by that Language.

This Problem is easy using Java and python as we can easily split the string using the inbuilt funtion.


Question :
The string that is passed is the 12 Hour format time String.
we have to return a string that is of 24 Hour Format.
